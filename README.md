# Elastic-Stack-SIEM

In this guide, I'll walk you through the process of setting up a home lab for Elastic Stack SIEM using the Elastic Cloud portal and a Kali Linux VM through the VMware Fusion hypervisor. I will generate security events on the Kali VM, configure an agent to forward the data to the SIEM, and then query and analyze the logs within the SIEM platform.


# 1. Setting up the Kali Linux VM

To set up Kali Linux in a virtual machine, download the appropriate VM image for VirtualBox or VMware from the official Kali Linux website, then create a new virtual machine using the downloaded image. Start the VM, follow the installation prompts, and use "kali" as both the username and password. Once installed, verify internet connectivity by pinging a site like google.com
